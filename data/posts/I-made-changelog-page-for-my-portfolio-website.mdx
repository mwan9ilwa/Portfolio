A Changelog page for any website is a good way to keep your audience up to date with new and meaningful changes.
In my previous post, I mentioned that I'll create changelog page for my portfolio website. I got free time on the weekend and worked on it.

<br />
<br />

#### Page link: [ma-ahmad/changelog](https://mahmad.me/changelog)

#### Github repo: [https://github.com/MA-Ahmad/myPortfolio](https://github.com/MA-Ahmad/myPortfolio)

<br />I used [Github Api](https://api.github.com) to fetch PR's of my portfolio
website. You can play with Github Api according to your requirements.

### <u>Packages:</u>

- [remark](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark)
- [remark-html](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-html)
- [react-html-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-html-parser)

> **Note:** I used above mentioned packages for mdx content processing.

<br />
Here is a chunk of code where I'm processing mdx content after fetching PR's list
of my portfolio website.

```ts
//Imports
import remark from 'remark'
import html from 'remark-html'

//Component code
const [prDataState, setPrDataState] = useState(null)
const processPrBody = async () => {
  await prData?.map(async (obj) => {
    if (obj.body) {
      const htmlBody = await remark().use(html).process(obj.body)
      obj['body_html'] = String(htmlBody)
    }
  })
  setPrDataState(prData)
}
```
