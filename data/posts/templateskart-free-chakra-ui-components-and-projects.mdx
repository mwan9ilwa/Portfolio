## Project Overview

**TemplatesKart** is a powerful set of fully responsive and accessible React components and projects.

## Demo Link

[https://templateskart.com](https://templateskart.com)

## How I built it

- **Framework**: Next.js
- **Styling**: Chakra UI
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **Deployment**: Vercel

There are 2 main sections in **TemplatesKart**

### 1. ProjectsKart

ProjectsKart provides an easy solution to getting the look you want for your website without having to mess around with too much code. User can view project pages and copy code of components.

### 2. ComponentsKart

It is a list of beautiful and responsive React components to build your application. Some of these components are extracted from **ProjectsKart** and some are built separately. <br />

## Why I built TemplatesKart

In 2020, I started learning **Reactjs** and I explored multiple React component libraries like **AntDesign, MaterialUI, Tailwindcss and ChakraUI**. All those libraries are great. But I found **ChakraUI** the best React component library although **ChakraUI** was new at that time. It Provides just enough to get started, implements sensible defaults, but is also very extensible and customisable. So I started using it and created multiple small projects with it. So far I built 5 to 10 projects with ChakraUI. Some projects are open source. In my new projects, sometimes i need to copy old components code from my previous projects. But it was time consuming process. Because I always need to open codebase of that specific project. So as per my needs and to make copy code process more convenient I created a **TemplatesKart** website. I added all my previous open source **ChakraUI** projects and most commonly used components.<br /><br />

**TemplatesKart** website is open source. Feel free to like and contribute.<br />
