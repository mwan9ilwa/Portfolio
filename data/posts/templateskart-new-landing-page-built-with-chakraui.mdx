**TemplatesKart** provides an easy solution to getting the look you want for your website without having to mess around with too much code.

I launched this website a week ago. Now I updated the following pages UI for better user experience.

1. Landing Page Sections - [https://templateskart.com](https://templateskart.com)

- Hero Section
- Key Features
- Product Overview

2. Projects Page - [https://templateskart.com/projects](https://templateskart.com/projects)
3. Components Page - [https://templateskart.com/components](https://templateskart.com/components)

## Some key features of TemplatesKart

- 50+ Components
- 6 Projects
- 100% Open Source
- Typescript Support
- Light and Dark Mode support for all components
- Fully Responsive components
